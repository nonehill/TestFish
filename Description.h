Try to find where the carp are in the water column. If they are cruising around on top then a bait just below the surface is deadly.\n\nWhen using ultra long hooklinks, casting can be made a lot easier by putting the end of the rig in a cup or pan. Then rested on the bank so it does not tangle or snag on any bank side vegetation on the backcast. Ideally you would want to eject the lead on the take so its not swinging around during the fight.

// HOW_TO_MAKE_BOILIES
//

#define HOW_TO_MAKE_BOILIES_INFO     @"The world of the boilie has evolved significantly since their invention over 30 years ago. Up until 15 years ago the choice was relatively straight forward. Roll your own or buy an ‘attractor style’ readymade. Whilst shelf life readymades have undoubtedly caught a lot of fish over the years they tend to cost a little more and rely on artificial additives and flavorings rather than a quality base mix.\n\nToday’s modern angler has the choice of extremely good quality freezer baits or employing the services of a rolling company. It would easily be possible to catch some of the biggest carp in the land and never know the ingredients of the bait on your hook.\n\nMore and more carp fishing has become about percentages. The big areas of carp angling will always remain the same, Location & Watercraft. Debatably these areas will account for 50%-75% of the skills you need to apply to catch carp.\n\nThe first step to make bait is to get some water boiling. A good starting point is a chip pan with a wire basket to allow you to boil a good few baits and then easily extract them at the end of their allotted time."

#define HOW_TO_MAKE_BOILIES_STEPS    @[@"The next step is to crack your eggs (put 50% of the egg shells in also as it adds a little texture to the finished bait) Then add your liquid and powered ingredients. Roughly speaking 5 eggs will account for 500g of base mix.", @"This needs to be mixed until it wont absorb any more base mix. If its too soft it will stick later on, so a very firm paste is ideal. If you are hand mixing wait until you can no longer get a spoon through it and then get your hand in to knead it. Be sure to push the dry powder right through the gooey ball to get it evenly mixed. Ideally a good quality mixer with a dough hook makes this stage much quicker and easier.", @"Half of the mix should be torn off and then roughly rolled into a sausage and dropped into the bait gun. This can then be squeezed through the gun into little sausages.", @"Getting the nozzle the right size for your rolling table is a bit tricky at first so trial and error will get one that gives you perfect balls. Not that bait shape is that important. With a nozzle that is slightly too small barrels can be created instead. If you are using a throwing stick, perfect spheres are the optimum. My preference is the Gardner tables and boilie gun.", @"Once you’ve squeezed out a couple of sausages lay them over the rolling table. The table will trim off the excess either side. This can be used later to hand roll some hookbaits.", @"A good solid backwards and forwards motion on the rolling table will give you the shape you are looking for. Don’t be in too much of a rush and make sure that enough strokes are performed to give you a bait that won’t crack or break down on boiling.", @"Baits can then be boiled in the pan. If your hob isn’t very powerful don’t put so many in the pan that it knocks it off the boil for too long. You are looking to time them from when the pan is boiling. You can vary boiling time dependent on base mix, boilie diameter and its individual requirement. Anywhere between 60 seconds and 3 minutes is about right with most anglers choosing 90-120 seconds for general purpose baits.", @"After boiling, the baits need to go onto and absorbent material to take off the excess moisture. Kitchen towel is best.", @"Once cool, transfer them to a rack where air can get all around them. You’ll notice on the tray a dozen differently shaped baits. These were hand rolled from the off cuts of bait from the table and the mixture trapped in the nozzle. Essentially they are a handful of baits that give a different hookbait option.", @"Once they have gone through their first 3-4 hours of drying they can be placed in an air drying sack out of the way to continue to dry. For the first 24 hours try and mix them around as often as possible (every coupe of hours if possible) to avoid moisture being trapped between baits. 36 hours of air drying should give you a minimal amount of ice in the bag when you come to freeze them. If there is excessive ice in your poly bag once they are in the freezer they haven’t been dried long enough. It’s a typical trick of bait rolling companies to make the bait seem heavy when you are essentially paying for water. Most companies will charge you extra to air dry your bait. This isn’t because its a complex or time consuming process, just that the bait are 20-40% lighter and they make less money from you.\n\nSo there you have it: a very brief guide to rolling baits. Not an essential task and for the busy angler, maybe not something that warrants much attention. However, if you have time it can be the difference between an odd fish here and there and really unlocking a water.\n\nThe ability to customise your bait means that you can vary just about every aspect of it to suit your own angling situation."]


// HOW_TO_TACKLE_A_NEW_WATER
//

#define HOW_TO_TACKLE_A_NEW_WATER_INFO  @"Facing the unknown is an exciting challenge and none more so than the excitement of tackling a new venue for the first time. Meaning you need to start from the very beginning and work it all out. Everything is fresh and new and every little bit of knowledge is noted in great detail. When you finally succeed, the capture just seems so much more rewarding.\n\nThe general routine is to try and find out as much as you can about the history of the water and its inhabitants. The questions such as, stock density and sizes of fish? Are there any topography maps available? Where are the hotspots? Are there any sanctuary areas? Angling pressure? Does it fish well all year? What months seem to produce more than others? Do the fish generally turn up on the wind, or is it a ‘back of the wind’ venue? Do certain fish get caught from certain swims/areas? Does the lake receive much pressure? Baiting approach, i.e., boilies or particles etc?\n\nThe list is endless and can be very off putting when starting out. Start by building up as much information as possible about the place. It is like a big jigsaw puzzle and the more pieces you put together, the clearer the overall picture becomes.\n\nAlways leave an open mind and try not to fall into the trap of the old ‘folk lore’ scenario! The one where all the regulars say there’s no chance of catching a carp on a pop-up here mate and they’re all using bottom baits, but as soon as you pump out a pop-up, it rattles off!! We can all become a little stereo typed at times, particularly when you fish the same water year after year, so just try to keep an open mind At the same time, try and digest as much information as possible.\n\nThe key factor on any venue will be location and most initial work will be centered upon finding the fish and trying to work out their patrol routes or some sort of pattern to give an edge.\n\nWatch other anglers closely. The fish would have been subject to certain methods/ approaches by the regular anglers over a number of years. Try to be a little different. Simple things can make a world of difference. If no one is back leading - do it! If everyone seems to be fishing over big beds of bait - use singles or stringers! If the margins are being ignored - don’t ignore them! "
